# Sampling-With-R

This repository provides examples and tutorials for sampling techniques in R. It includes code snippets and data sets for common sampling methods, such as
-simple random sampling
-stratified sampling
-cluster sampling
-systematic sampling.

###### *The code and data can be used as a reference for researchers, students, and data analysts who need to perform sampling on data sets in R.*


Each directory includes a README file that provides an overview of the method and how it is implemented in R. The code is provided in R scripts and can be executed in an R environment or using RStudio. The data sets used in the examples are also included.

### License & Contribution

The repository is licensed under the MIT License, so the code and data can be freely used, modified, and distributed. Contributions to the repository are welcome and can be submitted via pull requests.
